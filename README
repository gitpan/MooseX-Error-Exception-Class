MooseX::Error::Exception::Class version 0.099

DESCRIPTION
    This module, when used as a parameter to the Moose metaclass, converts
    errors to subclasses of Exception::Class::Base.

    The "interface" (other than what is shown in the synopsis) is methods of
    the exception objects that are thrown.
